    <p><strong>Hi, I’m Ayanthi.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Sci-On is my little corner of the internet for science communication and art.
    </p>

    <p>Here, I focus on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pow-wow</strong> – the pick-of-my-week that truly wow-ed </li>
      <li><strong>sci art</strong> – the science-y art I make whenever something sparks an idea (it’s not all gold 😅)</li>
      <li><strong>drawn to science</strong> – little visuals that break down dense ideas</li>
      <li><strong>archive</strong> – a small collection of past posts and pieces that found a home somewhere on the web</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I enjoy breaking down scientific ideas into smaller, softer pieces — for myself,
      and for anyone else who might find them useful.
