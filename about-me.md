Hi, I’m **Ayanthi**, and **Sci-On** is my little corner of the internet for science communication and art.

Here, I focus on:

- **Pow-wow** – My **P**ick-**o**f-the-**W**eek, that truly wow-ed me!  
- **sci art** – The science-y art I make whenever something sparks an idea (It's not all gold! :/)  
- **drawn to science** – Little visuals that break down dense ideas  
- **archive** – A small collection of past posts and pieces that found a home somewhere on the web!

I enjoy breaking down scientific ideas into smaller, softer pieces — for myself, and for anyone else who might find them useful.
