      Sci-On is my little corner of the internet for science communication and art.

I am currently a graduate student at the Tata Institute for Genetics and Society. I study how neural precursor cells in *Drosophila* know which neurons to make - how they "read" positional and temporal cues to produce the right neuronal types. Broadly, I am interested in developmental biology, behaviour, and evo-devo. Outside the lab, I like to sing, draw, design, and write a little. Also, I sincerely believe in the unifying power of Bollywood dance moves, and I sometimes practise said moves with my cats, Mitthu and Kiki!

## Here, you will find

- **Pow-wows** - the pick-of-my-week of a paper that truly wow-ed me
- **Sci-art** - the science-y art I make whenever something sparks an idea (it’s not all gold 😅)
- **Drawn to Science** - little visuals that break down dense ideas
- **Archive** - a small collection of past posts and pieces that found a home somewhere on the web
